- Use shadcn-ui@latest instead of creating custom components, if there is a component available in shadcn-ui that fits the use case
- always for every use of supabase use the appropriate types defined in /types/database.types.ts. ALWAYS. if there is sth w/ supabase use the types from mentioned file.
- always use pnpm, only use npm if pnpm is not working for some reason. Use pnpm dlx.
